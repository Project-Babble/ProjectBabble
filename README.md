## Installation
### Windows
Head to the releases section and [download the latest installer](https://github.com/Project-Babble/ProjectBabble/releases/latest).

### MacOS and Linux
Install `git`, `curl` and a version of `python` (between `3.10` and `3.12`) for your distro.

Then, copy paste and run the following script into the terminal of your choice:

#### For the latest commit:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dfgHiatus/e1bce63cd6be1e8645c3b3adfd5b71a6/raw/26561da3b2bcf738f580176229e4853c18ddf554/project-babble-installer-latest.sh)"
```

#### For the latest tagged release:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dfgHiatus/a92a3caae24c1bfab1c7544537a654c5/raw/63573d5c882b4152c9434b9dd4bc888573fe9e98/project-babble-installer-tagged.sh)"
```

Once it's finished installing, you can update and run the Babble app by typing `babble-app` into your terminal. You *should* also be able to run the Windows executable through Wine!

*Sometimes, the update script can error out if there are updates to pull from git. Fear not, re-rerunning the script in most cases fixes things.*

#### Notes on Linux:

##### KDE Plasma

If your GUI window shows just the top row of radio buttons, set a resolution for the Babble App manually in KDE's Window Settings. 800x600y is a good starting point with plenty of empty space.

---

##### v4l2/v4l-linux

If you receive a `["Error listing UVC devices on Linux ... No such file or directory"]` when choosing/changing your camera, you'll need to install video4linux (`v4l-utils`) for your distro.

For Ubuntu or other distros with apt:
```bash
sudo apt-get install v4l-utils
```

---

##### tkinter

If you receive a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'` error message on run, you'll need to install `tkinter` for your distro.

For Ubuntu or other distros with apt:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
For Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
```
For MacOS:
```bash
brew install python-tk
```

---

##### udev

If you have trouble connecting to your Babble Board (IE being denied permission to access it), you will need to set up and configure [udev](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/udev-rules.html) rules.
